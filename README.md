## Android SDK Installation  
### Step 1.
#### a) Using Android Studio
Installing the SDK into your project by adding the following to your build.gradle:
```gradle
implementation 'com.bluecats:bluecats-android-sdk:2.1.4'
```

It will automatically add the extra dependencies for you:
```gradle
compile 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.4'
compile 'com.android.support:support-compat:24+'
compile 'com.android.support:support-core-utils:24+'
```

If you want to use your own dependencies on Gson and Support with another version, exclude the transitive dependencies like this:
```gradle
compile('com.bluecats:bluecats-android-sdk:2.1.4', {
        exclude group: 'com.google.code.gson', module: 'gson'
        exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'support-compat'
        exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'support-core-utils'
    })
```
Please **NOTE** that missing Gson or Support dependencies will cause a **runtime crash** due to ClassNotFoundException, so only exclude them from BlueCats SDK if you are sure you've included the correct dependencies in build.gradle.

### b) Using Eclipse
Follow the instructions detailed [here](https://gist.github.com/henrybluecats/33d11f7852b2d24157e9820543f88ede).

### Step 2.
Add the following to your ProGuard rules:
```
-renamesourcefileattribute SourceFile
-keepattributes LineNumberTable, SourceFile

-keep class com.bluecats.sdk.** {*;}
```

### Step 3.
Get an app token from [app.bluecats.com/apps](http://app.bluecats.com/apps) by clicking "Create New App" and giving your new app a name. Once created, your new app should appear in the list and you'll be able to access your app token by clicking the "Show App Token / Secret" button below it.

NOTE: If you don't already have an account on [app.bluecats.com](http://app.bluecats.com/), you will need to create one in order to progress past this point. If you're unsure of what to do, send an email to [sales@bluecats.com](mailto:sales@bluecats.com) and we'll gladly help you out!

### Requirements
#### AndroidManifest.xml
While the following XML isn't vital to add manually (the SDK adds it automatically), it's kept here for the sake of ensuring you understand what is required of the SDK. The permissions and service is the absolute minimum required to allow the SDK to run.
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />

<application ...>
  ...
  <service android:enabled="true" android:name="com.bluecats.sdk.BlueCatsSDKService" android:permission="android.permission.BIND_JOB_SERVICE"/>
</application>
```

If you want the SDK to start when the device starts, you may add this to your xml:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED" />

<application ...>
    ...

    <receiver android:name="com.bluecats.sdk.BlueCatsSDKServiceReceiver" >
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED" />
        </intent-filter>
    </receiver>
</application>
```

#### Android 8.0+ (Oreo) Background Execution Limits
Android 8 imposes limitations on what apps can do while running in the background. If there are no foreground componants running(include Activity or Foreground Service), the system will then shutdowns the app's background services as if the app had had called the services' Service.stopSelf() methods. And calling startService() method with no foreground componants running will cause an IllegalStateException to be thrown. See [more](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background)

#### Android 6.0+ (Marshmallow) Location Permissions
Android 6.0+ introduces a new permission model which changes the way Location Services permissions are managed. Before scanning for beacons the app is required to request location permissions from the user via a system dialogue. Detailed information on implementing location permission support in Android 6.0 can be found [here](https://developer.bluecats.com/guides/android-6-0-and-location-services-permissions).

#### Android SDK 4.3+ (API Level 18+)
The SDK will still work on lower versions of Android, but Bluetooth Low Energy Scanning will be disabled. You will still be able to make use of the Sites Nearby functionality as this does not involve scanning for beacons.

### Sample Code
See the sample [BlueCats Scratching Post](https://github.com/bluecats/bluecats-scratchingpost-android) app for usage and integration instructions.
